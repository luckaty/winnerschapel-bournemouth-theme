          <h4>Career and Business Breakthrough</h4>
          <p>God has been very faithful to I and my family -He has always come through for us at every point of our needs. During the business and career season in 2024, He gave me a job in a city far away from my family. For the past year, my wife has been applying for jobs to join me in that city, but despite numerous interviews, nothing worked out -and our faith was tested as we were keying into prophetic declarations to bring us together as a family and praying.
          Our resident pastor in Bournemouth where we reside as a family -also supported us in prayers. During the business and career season in 2025 in conjunction with the teachings on faith -the Spirit of God led the pastor to instruct me to apply for a job in Bournemouth. Brethren, I followed this guidance and God blessed me with the only job I applied for in Bournemouth -it was seamless. Now, my family and I are permanently living together.
          In addition, during this season, God gave us a double portion of blessing by expanding our business. - <strong>Brother A.A</strong></p>

          <h4>New Job</h4>
          <p>After Sunday service, the Resident Pastor walked up to me and said "You're going to get that job you're going for." He did not have any prior knowledge of me having an interview. That same week, I went for my final interview as a Software Engineer. I was sent an offer letter before I returned home. - <strong>Brother D.O</strong></p>

            <h4>Supernatural Turnaround via Kingdom Advancement Prayer</h4>
            <p>In the month of January, when one winner, one soul, was flagged, my family and I agreed to pray for an hour every day. On 22nd January 2025, I was accused of gross misconduct and which led to my dismissal. Without any atom of fear, our faith was alive, and we kept praying for souls to be won, and at exactly two weeks, God showed up. I got an email from my operations manager, and a meeting was scheduled for 2pm. Instead of preparing for the meeting, I went out to witness for Christ for 2hours before attending the meeting. The operations manager asked that I be immediately reinstated, with all benefits and wages paid. To God be all the glory! Indeed, every season works in this commission as our God supernaturally turned everything to my favour. May His name be praised forever. - <strong>Sister B.O.</strong></p>

            <h4>God's Faithfulness</h4>
            <p>When I came to the UK over a year ago, I was initially troubled about settling down with my family. We had issues with accommodation and getting a job. However, in one of the Sunday services, the resident pastor gave a charge that we should stop worrying because God, who brought us to the UK, will make a way. I stopped worrying and telling people about my challenge and started thanking and giving God praise. Since then, God has been showing up for me and my family by granting us favour and breakthroughs in several areas. Today, our Graduate visa application was granted.

            <h4>Medical Report Nullified via Kingdom Service</h4>
            <p>In October 2023, I was booked for a cervical screening test, which I attended, and received a bad report for abnormal cells and was referred by my GP to University Hospital Dorset for further investigation. An appointment for the procedure was booked for January 2024 at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital. Of course, I was devastated by this, especially because I was very unwell during that period. I feared the worst.
              I told our resident pastor, and he was praying with me. I prayed Kingdom advancement prayers, and I also fasted on my own. In January 2024, RP told me to take good advantage of the season and i seriously prepared for the 21days prayer and fasting, and prayed fervently for divine healing, during the one night with the king, Our Papa Bishop Oyedepo declared that one thing that God has blessed this mi with, is the testimony of what they saw before, they did not see again. I caught and held on to it, and the next week I went for the procedure, and the Doctor was surprised. She said Who booked you for this procedure. I can't find anything here. And she said Go and return in one year. I shared this testimony to the glory of God, and for it to be preserved.
              The next appointment was booked for January 2025, coinciding again with our season of 21 days of prayer and fasting. Today, 20th January 2025. Lo and behold, I went, and the report is the same. There are NO abnormal cells found. I was congratulated and told to go and no appointment until 3 years, which is usually given for persons with a normal report. PRAISE GOD!
              I have come once again to return all the glory to God almighty, Jehovah Rapha, the Mighty Healer. Our God is indeed Faithful and Answers Prayers. Amen and Amen üôè - <strong>Sister D.O</strong></p>

            <h4>Healed of Cervical Stenosis</h4>
            <p>In July, I was experiencing excruciating pains in my lower abdomen, which landed me at the Emergency unit, and I was diagnosed with cervical stenosis(which is the accumulation of blood in my uterus) and a surgery was carried out to drain out the blood.
But the doctor told me to expect the pains every month because my menstrual flow was not coming out, rather it was accumulating in my uterus, causing me pains due to the blockage of my Cervix, and he gave me two options, which were. Monthly surgery to drain out the blood
2. Total removal of my womb
I cried to God asking him for total and perfect healing, and he answered me accordingly.
The next month came with excruciating pains, and I kept on praising God despite the pains, and two days later, my menstrual flow came back after three months of pain. - Hallelujah <strong>Sister O.N</strong></p>
