          <p>“You shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee”. Here at Winners Chapel International Bournemouth, there is a place for everyone. We have many opportunities for every person to minister and in turn, be ministered to. Take the time to explore the different ministry opportunities and take the time to serve. There are many benefits of kingdom service and the word of God validates this in Exodus 23:25.</p>
