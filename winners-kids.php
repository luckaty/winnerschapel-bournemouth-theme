Our Kids Church is designed as a joyful, creative, and explorative space where children can understand the Gospel in ways that are appropriate for their age.

                    Through lively worship, captivating Bible stories, interactive activities, and meaningful friendships, we aim to build a solid foundation of faith in our children’s hearts. Our enthusiastic team of volunteers is committed to investing in kids’ lives and guiding them towards a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

                    Stay connected with us via our website and social media channels for updates on upcoming events, resources, and ways to engage with the Kids Church community. We are thrilled to partner with you in raising a generation of children who know and love Jesus, making a positive impact in their families, schools, and communities.

                    Thank you for being part of our Kids Church family. We look forward to seeing how God moves in our children’s lives as we embark together on this wonderful journey of faith!
